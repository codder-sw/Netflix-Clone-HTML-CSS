# netflix-clone-html-css
This is my first project, where I learned a lot of new thingsâ€”especially how to use GitHub as a tool, which was a challenge in itself. This project helped me understand responsive design, layout structuring, and CSS styling from scratch.

I'm just at the beginning of my journey in web development, and this project motivated me to keep improving my skills and learn more advanced concepts like JavaScript, frameworks, and deployment.

A responsive Netflix homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. Hosted with GitHub Pages.
